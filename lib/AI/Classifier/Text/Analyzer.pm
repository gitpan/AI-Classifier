=head1 NAME

AI::Classifier::Text::Analyzer - computing feature vectors from documents

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AI::Classifier::Text::Analyzer;

    my $analyzer = AI::Classifier::Text::Analyzer->new();
    
    my $features = $analyzer->analyze( 'aaaa http://www.example.com/bbb?xx=yy&bb=cc;dd=ff' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Computes feature vectors of text using some heuristics and adds words count 
(using L<Text::WordCounter> by default).

The object is immutable - but some methods use a second parameter as an accumulator for the
features found in given text.

It uses some specific values and methods that work for our case - but are not guaranteed
to bring good results universally - see the source for details!

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item C<word_counter>

Object with a word_count method that will calculate the frequency of words in a text document.
By default L<Text::WordCounter>.

=item C<global_feature_weight>

The weight assigned for computed features of the text document. By default 2.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<< new(word_counter => $foo, global_feature_weight => 3) >>

Creates a new AI::Classifier::Text::Analyzer object. Both arguments are optional.

=item C<analyze($document, $features)>

Computes the feature vector of the given document and adds the initial vector of C<$features>.

=item C<analyze_urls($document, $features)>

Computes a vector special url related features of a given text - currently there are used 
C<NO_URLS>, C<MANY_URLS> and C<REPEATED_URLS> features.  

=item C<filter($document)>

Removes html related parts from the text.
